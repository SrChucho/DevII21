# Dev II - Development Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks for Development Economics.

- github repository: [github.com/jhconning/DevII](https://github.com/jhconning/DevII21)
- rendered website: [jhconning.github.io/DevII/](https://jhconning.github.io/DevII21/) 

These materials support the PhD **Econ 842: Development Seminar II** at The Graduate Center at The City University of New York, but some of the jupyter notebooks may be of more general interest.  


[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) mix markdown text, math, and executable code (in python, R, and stata) to produce output and visualizations. Many notebooks can be run interactively by clicking the rocket button ![](media/launch_button.png) at the top of each relevant page. This will launch the notebook in the cloud on a jupyter kernel server ([Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index) or [Binder](https://mybinder.org)). Alternatively, download the notebook, or clone the entire [DevII](https://github.com/jhconning/DevII21) repository, to your local machine and run it there. Guides to getting started with jupyter, github, and python in the [Tools](notebooks/tools.md) section.
